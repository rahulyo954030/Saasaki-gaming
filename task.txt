Write an employee management API -
Create, update, delete, read operations for employee Object (ID, Name, Date of Joining, Department, Created By User ID).

User Object - Create a register and Login API for User Object. Only logged in User can create an Employee.

Only the User which has created an employee can update or delete an Employee. 

Example - Lets say you have created 5 Users in the Mongo DB database, U1, U2, U3, U4 , U5. 
The employee created by U2 can only be updated or deleted by U2
Lets say U2 created an employee E55 so U3,U4, U1, or U5 cannot update or delete the employee object E55 only U2 can. 
 

Use Mongo DB + Nodejs to create the API.

You have to just create the API, No fronend required.
